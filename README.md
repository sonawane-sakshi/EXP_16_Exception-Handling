## Aim 
To use excepttion handling.

## Software Used 
VS Code

## Theory
**Definition**
In C++, exception handling is amechanism that provides a way to manage errors and exceptional situations in a structured manner. The primary components involved in exception handling are:

Key Concepts:

* Exception: An event that disrupts the normal flow of a program. In C++, exceptions are typically represented as objects derived from the std::exception class.
* Throwing an Exception: Use the throw keyword to signal that an error has occurred. This transfers control to a nearby catch block.
* Catching an Exception: Use try blocks to enclose code that may throw exceptions. Corresponding catch blocks handle specific types of exceptions.

```cpp
try {
    // Code that might throw an exception
} catch (const ExceptionType& e) {
    // Handle the exception
}

```
* Multiple Catch Blocks: You can have multiple catch blocks to handle different exception types, allowing for more specific error handling.

```cpp
try {
    // Code that may throw
} catch (const std::runtime_error& e) {
    // Handle runtime errors
} catch (const std::exception& e) {
    // Handle all other exceptions
}
```
* Catch-All Handler: A catch-all handler (catch (...)) can be used to catch any exception that wasnâ€™t previously caught.

```cpp
catch (...) {
    // Handle any exception
}
```
* Custom Exceptions: You can define your own exception classes by inheriting from std::exception, allowing for more meaningful error information.
```cpp
  class MyException : public std::exception {
public:
    const char* what() const noexcept override {
        return "My custom exception occurred!";
    }
};
```

## Algorithms
#### Age Validation Algorithm

1. **Start**.
2. **Initialize** a variable `age` to store the user's input.
3. **Prompt** the user to "Enter your age:".
4. **Read** the user's input into the variable `age`.
5. **Try** the following:
   1. **Check** if `age` is less than 0:
      - If true, **throw** an exception indicating an invalid age.
   2. **Check** if `age` is less than 18:
      - If true, **throw** an exception indicating that the user is below 18.
   3. If both checks are false, **print** "Accepted".
6. **Catch** any exceptions:
   - If the exception indicates an invalid age (less than 0), **print** "Invalid age".
   - If the exception indicates age below 18, **print** "You are below 18".
7. **End**.

#### Zerodvision Error Algorithm 

1. **Start**.
2. **Declare** variables `n1`, `n2`, and `ans` to store the two numbers and the result.
3. **Prompt** the user to "Enter the values of numbers 1 and 2:".
4. **Read** the user's input into the variables `n1` and `n2`.
5. **Try** the following:
   1. **Check** if `n2` is equal to 0:
      - If true, **throw** an exception with the value of `n2`.
   2. If the check is false, calculate `ans` as `n1 / n2`.
   3. **Print** the result as "The answer is [result]".
6. **Catch** any exceptions:
   - If an exception occurs, **print** "ERROR: Division by [number]".
7. **End**.

## Conclusion
We learnt to use exception hndling blocks in this experiment.
